# Bug report export

Part of the [OpenJam feature set](README.md).

## What it does

OpenJam exports everything it captured as a **single, self-contained HTML file**
([README](../../README.md)). Open it offline and it plays back the
[session replay](session-replay.md), renders the correlated timeline of
[captured events](data-capture.md), and shows the [screenshots](screenshots.md) — no
server, no account, no internet required.

Because the report is one file with no external dependencies, it is also the unit of
sharing: it only leaves your machine if *you* send the file. See
[Privacy & data control](privacy.md).

## What to expect / limitations

- Everything is inlined, so the file size scales with session length and captured data.
- The report is built locally by `report-builder.js` and rendered by `viewer.js` / `renderer.js`.
- `meta.capture` says how the session was recorded: `cdp` (Chrome debugger) or `inject`
  (reduced mode, see [Data capture](data-capture.md#when-chromes-debugger-is-unavailable-reduced-mode)).
  The viewer header shows a `Capture` item only for reduced-mode reports.

## Test data

- Report builder tests: `test/report-builder.test.js`, `test/packaging.test.js`
- e2e that builds and exports a report: `test/e2e/build-export.mjs`
- Sample exported reports you can open: `eval/out/with-manifest.html`, `eval/out/without-manifest.html`
